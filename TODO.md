# TODO: Optimize Site and Add Mobile Version

## Optimization
- [x] Use React.lazy() and Suspense for lazy loading heavy components in App.jsx (e.g., SmartMaterialViewer, page components like EnglishGrammar, Korean, etc.)

## Mobile Version
- [x] Add responsive CSS media queries to style.css for screens max-width 768px (adjust layout to column, padding, font sizes, hide/show elements)

## Testing and Deployment
- [x] Build the project and test locally
- [x] Deploy to GitHub Pages if changes are good
