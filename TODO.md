- [x] Add animations to sidebar items, buttons, inputs, and content areas
- [x] Add subtle background animations to main container (moving gradients or floating elements)
- [x] Enhance NeonTitle.jsx with more dynamic effects
- [x] Test app functionality (login, routing, menu toggles)
- [x] Run development server to verify visual changes
